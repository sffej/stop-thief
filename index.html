      Thief movement rules (in this order):
      <ol>
        <li>For each CLUE, the thief will either MOVE or WAIT (see probabilities).</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, the thief will always use the SUBWAY if the thief is on one of the 5 STREET spaces with SUBWAY access, unless the thief has just used the SUBWAY 1 MOVE ago. While using the SUBWAY, the thief cannot be arrested, and a TIP cannot be used. The MOVE after using the SUBWAY is always 1 of the 5 STREET spaces with SUBWAY access (Note: this can be the same STREET space where the thief was 1 MOVE ago.) The next MOVE never uses the SUBWAY.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, if the thief has just moved onto a DOOR or WINDOW, the thief will continue through to the other side.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, the thief can move up to 2 board spaces in any direction (including diagonally) to land on a numbered space. If the first of the 2 board spaces is a numbered space, the thief will stop in that space (e.g. The thief cannot move from 4-41 to 3-31, because the thief would stop in 8-30.). However, the thief can step around numbered spaces (e.g. The thief can move from 4-71 to 3-71, stepping around 8-70.). This establishes the set of available spaces.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, if there are 1 or more available unused indoor CRIME spaces, the thief will choose ranomdly from among them and move to it. A used indoor CRIME space is considered a FLOOR space until it is restocked, and a used outdoor CRIME space (the NEWS STAND) is considered a STREET space until it is restocked. Indoor CRIME spaces are restocked when the thief leaves the building; the NEWS STAND is restocked after the thief COMPLIES with a CORRECT ARREST.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, the thief will never move into a numbered space where the thief was last turn, a direct U-turn. (But the thief can move into a space where the thief was 2 turns ago, making a triangle.) (Remember that a CRIME space turns into a FLOOR or STREET space until the CRIME space is restocked.)</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, the thief will choose randomly from the available spaces with equal probability.</li>
        <li>After an INCORRECT ARREST, the thief will do nothing.</li>
        <li>After a CORRECT ARREST, the thief will either COMPLY or RUN (see probabilities).</li>
        <li>After a RUN, the thief will MOVE 5 or 6 times (see probabilities).</li>
      </ol>
